# Omnidirectional Mobile Robot

## Project Description
This project involves the design, simulation, and control of a four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot capable of catching a thrown ball. The robot was manufactured using Nema 23 stepper motors, optical encoders, and an Arduino Mega 2560. A camera is used in conjunction with computer vision and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to estimate the robotâ€™s position and orientation. The project includes a Sliding Mode Controller and a simulation environment in PyBullet.
